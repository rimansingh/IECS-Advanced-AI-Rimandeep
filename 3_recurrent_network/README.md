# 3_Recurrent_Networks Exercises

This folder contains exercises designed to explore recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using PyTorch. The exercises include implementations of various RNN architectures, such as LSTMs and GRUs, along with their applications in sequence prediction tasks.

## Contents
- [Exercise 1: Implementing LSTM](cci:7://file:///Users/rimansingh/University/sem-3/Adv-AI/IECS-Advanced-AI-Rimandeep/3_recurrent_network/exercise_1.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to implement an LSTM for sequence prediction.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.8)
- PyTorch
- Other dependencies as specified in the main README.

## Running the Exercises
1. Open the exercise notebook in Jupyter.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercises.
